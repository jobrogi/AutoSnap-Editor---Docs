# 📐 AutoSnap – Editor Plugin

**AutoSnap – Editor** is a lightweight Unreal Engine 5 plugin that enhances your level design workflow with hotkey-based snapping controls. It allows precise modular asset placement while dragging actors in the editor — without touching Unreal’s built-in grid snapping.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔧 Snap actors automatically.
- ⌨️ Hotkey toggles for X, Y, Z axis snapping
- 🌀 Snap distance control via Shift + Mouse Wheel
- 🧱 Optional grid overlay (visual feedback)
- 🧠 Toggle debug logs for tracking snap state
- 🧩 Minimal, efficient C++/Blueprint-friendly setup

---

## 🔧 Installation

If you installed this from the **Fab Marketplace**, Unreal will automatically place the plugin into your project's `Plugins` folder.

### 1. Enable the Plugin
Go to:
> You can also toggle it from the main menu:

### 2. Restart the Editor
You must restart the Unreal Editor for the plugin to activate.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- Enable AutoSnap via  `Shift + G` and Disable Unreal Engine's Legacy Snapping Logic in editor.
- The plugin does **not** override or depend on native UE snapping.
- It uses your defined snap size and axis settings.
- Snap size can be dynamically increased or decreased.
- You can enable/disable snapping on individual axes (X, Y, Z).
- A visual grid or log feedback system is available.

## ⚠️ Disable Native UE Grid Snapping

When using **AutoSnap**, you should disable Unreal Engine’s **built-in grid snapping** to avoid conflicts.

AutoSnap provides its own snapping system, and leaving this toggle on may lead to inconsistent movement or double-snapping behavior.

To disable native snapping:

1. Locate the **Snapping Toolbar** in the top editor bar.
2. **Uncheck the grid snapping icon** (see below):
